# Amazon Glacier Client

A quick and dirty Java-based client for Amazon Glacier which I use for off-site backups.  It's not polished like I normally would for other people to use, but you are welcome to use it if you need to.  Really I am just putting this up here to make sure I have access to the code in case I lose everything I have locally.
